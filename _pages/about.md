I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Texas - Arlington (UTA). Before my current appointment at UTA, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Drexel University, working with Professor [David K. Han](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/H/han-david/). Before joining Drexel, I was a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the GRASP Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, working under the supervision of Professor [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). My research interests revolve around machine learning and geometric approaches to computer vision with applications in robotics. My research focuses on 3D vision, symmetry detection, 3D Reconstruction, graph neural networks, robot perception, and reinforcement learning.

I received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from the [National University of Colombia](https://medellin.unal.edu.co), in 2010, 2012, and 2020 respectively. I was a visiting researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and later at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am currently **recruiting Ph.D. students** to join my research group in geometric computer vision. This area includes topics such as 3D reconstruction, structure-from-motion, etc. If you're interested, please email me with the subject line **"future maverick"** and include your CV, academic transcripts, and a short paragraph describing your research experience. Priority will be given to applicants with a masterâ€™s degree and prior publications. Emails without the specified subject may be missed due to filtering.
