I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Texas - Arlington (UTA). Before my current appointment at UTA, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Drexel University, working with Professor [David K. Han](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/H/han-david/). Before joining Drexel, I was a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the GRASP Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, working under the supervision of Professor [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). My research interests revolve around machine learning and geometric approaches to computer vision with applications in robotics. My research focuses on 3D vision, symmetry detection, 3D Reconstruction, graph neural networks, robot perception, and reinforcement learning.

I received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Engineering from the [National University of Colombia](https://medellin.unal.edu.co), in 2010, 2012, and 2020 respectively. I was a visiting researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and later at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am **hiring PhD students**. If you think you are a fit, please email "diego.patino at uta.edu" with the **exact** subject: prospective phd student. In the email, please include a CV and a document with a few paragraphs describing your skills and expertise in 3D computer vision and machine learning. Additional documents, such as transcripts, GRE, english proficiency, etc., are also helpful. If you follow these instructions, I will eventually review the documents and get back to you. Otherwise, I will miss the email.
