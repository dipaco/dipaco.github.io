    - title: Ph.D. Computer Engineering
      institution: National University of Colombia - Medellín
      year: 2020
      description:
        - The topic of my Ph.D. dissertation was ¨Shape Analysis and Description Based on the Isometric Invariances of Topological Skeletonization¨. My research focused on shape analysis with applications on shape retrieval and shape classification. In my dissertation, I designed an equivariant feature descriptor to classify shapes based on the properties of their Medial Axis.

        - I successfully applied the approach developed in my work to the problem of pose-invariant shape classification and retrieval in 2D and 3D. All the methods and algorithms in my Ph.D. research were designed and coded using state-of-the-art technologies including data parallelism and GPU-enabled frameworks.
